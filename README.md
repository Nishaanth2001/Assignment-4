React Redux.

This is a simple app using redux functions.

I have made this app for reading out dishes from the menu such that they can read it out to the customers, it has functions to easily and and remove dishes when necessary.

First install all the required dependencies from the package.json file.

Check whether the gradle version is 6.3 to setup the environment.

Create src folder in the Project folder form both stack screens.

Now Run the app.

Enter your entries.
